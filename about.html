                </ul><ul class="about_list">
                  <li>â¢ Market will be settled as set out in the Market Information and/or the Specific Sports Rules.</li>
                  <li>â¢ If the Market Information or Specific Sports Rules do not indicate whether and on what basis the market will be settled, markets will be settled on the official outcome of the governing body concerned, irrespective of any subsequent disqualification or alteration of the outcome (except if an adjustment is declared within 24 hours of the initial settlement of the relevant market in order to correct an errors in the reporting of the result).</li>
                  <li>â¢ When no official results of the relevant governing body are available, the results will be decided by the use of information from independent sources. In such cases, if any new information comes into the public domain within 48 hours of date of settlement, it shall (in a fair manner) decide either: (i) whether the market should be reinstated or resettled in the light of this new information; or (ii) whether or not to wait for further information before determining whether to reinstate or resettle the market. Unless it has declared that it is waiting for further information which comes into the public domain more than 48 hours after the market has been settled shall not be considered (regardless of whether or not such information might have contributed to a different outcome).</li>
                  <li>â¢ In the event of any uncertainty as to any result or possible outcome, it reserves the right to suspend settlement of any market for an indefinite period of time until the uncertainty can be resolved to a reasonable satisfaction. It reserves the right to void any market if the ambiguity cannot be resolved to satisfactory degree of satisfaction.</li>
                  <li>b) Resettlements</li>
                  <li>â¢ Markets are usually settled immediately after the end of the event in question. It may settle (or part settle) other markets before the official outcome is declared (or it may increase the customer eligible to betâ balance by the minimum possible winnings of that customer on a given market) solely as a customer service benefit. Nevertheless, it reserves the right to change the market settlement if: the official outcome is different from the outcome on which the market was originally decided (for example, the result of horse racing is adjusted by the relevant governing shortly after the race, but before the result is official); or (ii) whether the entire market is subsequently voided (for example for abandoned event).</li>
                  <li>â¢ This reserves the right to reverse the settlement of a market if the market is fixed in error (for example, a human or technical error).</li>
                  <li>â¢ If a market is resettled, this may lead to amendments to the customerâs balance to reflect adjustments in the market settlement.</li>
                  <li>c) Non-runners, withdrawals and disqualifications</li>
                  <li>â¢ Subject always be entitled to void bets under its terms and conditions or for any exception under the Exchange Rules, whether the market includes a provision that states, âAll bets stand, run or notâ (or anything similar) in the Market Information, then all bets on a team or competitor will stand regardless of whether or not a team or competitor begins the event or take part in the event.</li>
                  <li>â¢ In the event that market information does not stipulate that all bets will be made irrespective of participation, customers should refer to the applicable Specific Sports Rules.</li>
                  <li>â¢ If a team or competitor is disqualified, withdraws, or forfeits after beginning an event, they will be deemed a loser if at least one other team or competitor completes the event. If no team or competitor completest an event (starting) then all bets will be invalid excepts bets on any market that have been unconditionally determined.</li>
                  <li>d) Winner with [named selection]' markets</li>
                  <li>â¢ It can from time to time offer markets that are depended on the participation of a particular competitor. If the competitor named in either the âWinner withâ¦â market title on the Market Information does not participate in the tournament or event, then all bets on the market will be invalid. For example, if there was a âWinner with Federerâ tennis market, all bets on the market would be invalid if Federer did not participate in the tournament. Nevertheless, if any other competitor did not join, the bets would stand.</li>
                  <li>â¢ A team or competitor maybe deemed to have participated if they have participated to the degree required to record an official to record an official result or classification (including any disqualification but excluding any ânot start or equivalent classification).</li>
                  <li>3. Abandonments, Cancellation, Postponements</li>
                  <li>â¢ Some markets have different rules, which are set out in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. However, if the market does not have any provisions in the Specific Sports Rules or the Market Information relating to abandonment, cancellation and/or postponement the following shall apply.</li>
                  <li>â¢ In relation to any match, fixture, game, individual event, race or the like: if the event is not completed with three days of the scheduled completion date, all bets on the markets for that event will be invalid, except for bets on any markets that have been unconditionally determined.</li>
                  <li>â¢ In relation to any tournament, competition or the like: if the event is not concluded within three days of the scheduled date of completion, all markets relating to the event must be resolved in compliance with the official decision of the governing body concerned, providing that the decision is taken within 90 days of the scheduled date of completion. If no official ruling is released in this 90-day period, then bets on any market relating to this event will be invalid, except bets on any markets that have been unconditionally established. If the market is to be cancelled but part settled as favour to the customer, then such part-settled bets will be reversed and all bets on the market will be invalid.</li>
                  <li>â¢ It will decide (acting reasonably) whether a market relates to a match (or similar) or a tournament (or similar). However, by way of example, the following shall apply: (i) Europa League outright = tournament; (ii) Championsâ League Group outright = tournament; (iii) Top Premiership goal scorer = tournament; (iv) 72-hole Golf Match bet = match; (v) Ryder Cup outright = tournament; (vi) Golf tournament outright = tournament; (vii) Tennis Tournament outright = tournament;(viii) 5-day Cricket Test Match = match; (ix) Ashes Series outright winner = tournament; (x) Motor Race (e.g. Grand Prix) = match.</li>
                  <li>4. Change of venue</li>
                  <li>â¢ Some markets have different rules which are set out in the Relevant Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. However, if the change of location is not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules and/or Market Information the following shall apply:</li>
                  <li>â¢ For any team sport: If the scheduled venue is changed after that market is loaded, all bets will be invalid if the new is the home of the original away team.</li>
                  <li>â¢ For all categories or markets other than team sports: If the venue is changed after the market is primed, all bets will stand.</li>
                  <li>â¢ If there is a change in the type of schedule surface (for example, hockey match switching from grass to Astor-turf) after the market has been primed, all bets will stand.</li>
                  <li>5. Periods of time</li>
                  <li>â¢ Some markets have different rules, which are set out in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. However, if not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules or the Market Information the following shall apply.</li>
                  <li>â¢ If the planned duration of an event changes after the market has been loaded but before the event begins, all bets will be invalid.</li>
                  <li>â¢ Some markets refer to the period of time before the event happens (for example, time of the first goal). If an event happens in stoppage or injury time after any regular period of time, it would be deemed to have happened at the end of the regular period of time. For example, if the goal is scored in the first half stoppage time in a soccer match, it would be considered to have happened in 45 minutes.</li>
                  <li>â¢ All bets apply to entire full âregular timeâ period, including stoppage time. Any extra time and/or penalty shoot-out is not included.</li>
                  <li>â¢ References within these Rules and Regulations to a particular to a certain number of âdaysâ shall mean the end of the local day after the expiry of the specified number of days. For example, if the rugby match is scheduled for 1st December, then the rule that allows the match to be completed within three days after of the scheduled completion date (see paragraph 3 above) would mean that the deadline for the completion of that match would be 23:59:59 on the 4th of December.</li>
                  <li>â¢ 6. Match Bets</li>
                  <li>â¢ Some markets have specific rules, which are set out in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. For example, the rules for match bets on the golf markets are laid down in the Specific Sports Rules. However, if not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules or the Market Information, the following shall apply.</li>
                  <li>â¢ âMatch Betâs for one-off events are decided by the competitor or team with the best score, time or finishing position in the event. If none of the competitors or teams involved in a match bet completes an event or records a score, time or finish place, then bets are void unless otherwise specified in the Specific Sports Rules and/or Market Information. Any competitor or team not completing an event or registering a score, time or finishing place having take part in match bet event will be decided as a loser if at least one other team or competitor completes the event or reports a score, time or finishing place.</li>
                  <li>â¢ âMatch Betâ for progression in a competition or event with several heats or rounds shall be decided by a competitor or team that qualifies for the furthest round (whether or not it takes place in the next round) or with the best score, time, or finishing position in the final or the same hear of that competition or event. If the same competitors or teams fail to advance in the same round of the competition but in different heats, so dead-heat rules will apply, regardless of the finishing positions in their respective heats. Markets will be partly settled at the end of each round and any resulting disqualifications, fines or modifications to outcomes or qualifications will have no effect on the market. If one or more of the competitors or teams are disqualified, for the settlement purposes, the disqualified competitor or team shall be considered to have made more progress in the competition or event than all those eliminated from the competition or event previous to prior disqualification and shall be deemed to have finished last (or joint last where there is more than one disqualification) of those currently competing in the competition or event. Disqualification shall be deemed to have taken place by the relevant governing body at the time the competitorâs or team was excluded from the competition or event rather than at the time of the incident when induced disqualification.</li>
                  <li>â¢ If one of the competitors or teams does not partake in the game, all applicable match bets will be invalid.</li>
                  <li>â¢ If an event or tournament is abandoned or shortened in duration in such a manner that any competitor or team refuses to complete the match bet, event or tournament for some reasons other than withdrawal or disqualification, otherwise all bets will be invalid except those on markets that have been unconditionally determined.</li>
                  <li>7. âTo qualifyâ markets</li>
                  <li>â¢ Some market has specific laws, as are laid out in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. Nevertheless, whether it is dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules or the Market Information, the following shall apply.</li>
                  <li>â¢ Any âqualifyingâ market (for example, âto reach the finalâ markets) will be decided by the competitor or team who is qualified under the criteria laid out in Market Information, whether, or not they compete in the next round or event for which they have qualified. Markets will be settled after the qualifying stage and any resulting disqualification or amendment of the result will not be counted.</li>
                  <li>â¢ 8. Dead heats</li>
                  <li>â¢ If otherwise stated in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information the Dead Heat Rules applies to bets on a market where there are more winners than predicted (as set out in the Market Information) divided by the number of real winners (for example, stake multiplied by (number or winners expected/number of real winners)). Winnings are then charged to the active supporters on this âreduced stakeâ (reduced stake multiplied by traded price) and the remaining stakes are charged to the appropriate layers.</li>
                  <li>â¢ For example, assume there is a dead heat for first place between three horses. 'Client A' has backed one of the winners for a stake of 300 at the traded price of 4.0 and 'Client B' has taken the other side of this bet. When the event is settled, the stake (300) is multiplied by 1/3 (i.e. the number of expected winners (1) divided by the number of actual winners (3)) to calculate the reduced stake (100) and the remainder given to the layer (200). The backer then receives the traded price matched (4.0) multiplied by the reduced stake (4 x 100 = 400). In this example, Client A's net winnings are 100 (400 pay-outs minus the original 300 stake), and Client B's net losses are 100. Alternatively, this can be viewed as the full amount paid to the traded price divided by the number of dead heaters. In the above example, this would be 300 at the traded price of 4.0 (1200) divided by 3, making 400 pay-outs and 100 net winnings.</li>
                  <li>â¢ By way of another example, assume there is an outright winner in a golf tournament, but 7 players tie for 2nd place. In the "top 5 finish" market, after settling on the outright winner in the top 5 market there would be 4 others designated winnerâs places available. 'Client A' has backed one of the winners for 300 at the traded price of 4.0 and 'Client B' has taken the other side of this bet. When the event is settled, the stake (300) is multiplied by 4/7 (i.e. the number of expected winners (4) divided by the number of actual winners (7)) to calculate the reduced stake (171.43) and the remainder given to the layer (128.57). The backer then receives the traded price matched (4.0) multiplied by the reduced stake (4 x 171.43 = 685.72). In this example, Client A's net winnings are 385.72 (685.72 payout minus the original 300 stake), and Client B's net losses are 385.72.</li>
                  <li>â¢ In the case of customers whose betting counterparty, for the purposes of this section of the Exchange Rules dealing with dead heat, the âClient Aâ, âClient Bâ and âcorrect layersâ should relevant, be read.</li>
                  <li>9. Exchange Multiples</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text_14">The Exchange Rules only apply to Exchange Multiples.</p>
                <ul class="about_list">
                  <li>â¢ Customers making a multiple bet will bet on each other as the counterparty to the bet.</li>
                  <li>â¢ A multiple bet is made up of a variety or legs. The leg is described as one or more selected choices in any individual event market.</li>
                  <li>â¢ It reserves the right, at its own discretion, not to allow multiple bets or to scale back stakes under certain circumstances.</li>
                  <li>â¢ All multiple bets made are subject to the Exchange Rules that apply to each individual sport that applies to each multiple bet.</li>
                  <li>â¢ Customers can position as Exchange Multiple bet using back, or where appropriate, lay or mix back and lay options. Nevertheless, customers cannot have a mix of back and lay options in any one leg.</li>
                  <li>â¢ When customers prefer more than one selection in one leg, the odds for that leg will be dutched, which means that they will be combined to represent the probability of any selections within the leg winning (when backed) or of all the choices losing (if set). If customers choose to put a cross-multiple bet (for example, more than option in any event but not using âdutchedâ prices) that Exchange Multiple bet would need to be entered separately.</li>
                  <li>â¢ Other than the Exchange Multiple bets on the Starting Price (âBSPâ), the odds available on the Exchange Multiple product will be broadly dependent on the applicable single markets on the Exchange and any such winning multiple bet will be subject to commission as set out in the Charges section of the website.</li>
                  <li>â¢ Any winnings from Exchange Multiple bet made at BSP will not be subject to commission, but the odds returned on leg of such multiple will be subject to a 5% deduction from BSP.</li>
                  <li>â¢ A BSP each way Exchange Multiple bet is a bet to win different choices and a bet to put the same choices. For example, a wager of INR 2 either way double is a bet of INR 2 for both selections to be won and a bet of INR 2 for both selections to be put, with a total bet stake INR 4. The number of positions for each event in each manner where several bets are shown on multiples where win Market Information and do not change. Whether the number of runners is equal to or less than the number of places available, the relevant place leg of any multiple bet would be invalid.</li>
                  <li>â¢ If, at its own discretion, will determine the markets that are available for Exchange Multiples. Events available for Exchange Multiples should be those listed under the individual Exchange Multiple Group. Not all markets will be made available via the Exchange Multiples product.</li>
                  <li>â¢ With the exception of the clause directly below, if any pick of either leg is a non-runner or otherwise invalid under the Exchange Rules (for example, abandoned match) then all bets on that particular leg will be invalid and the Exchange Multiple Bet must be changed accordingly. For example, a treble with one void leg will become a double leg. It ensures that if customers have more than one pick in each leg (for example, âditchingâ) and one of those selections is a non-runner, the entire leg will be invalid. In the case that voided legs mean that an individual bet within the multiple is a singe bet, the singe bet must stand.</li>
                  <li>â¢ Notwithstanding the rule immediately above, for Exchange Multiple bets struck at BSP, if customers have more than one pick in each leg and one of those choices is a non-runner the leg must stand. For example, if customers back both Desert Orchid and Red Rum in an individual horse race and Red Rum is a non-runner, the leg will become a back of just Desert Orchid.</li>
                  <li>â¢ This retains the right not to consider such variations of Exchange Multiples, such as those containing similar contingencies (for example, where the result of one event is likely to influence the odds on the result of another event). It will happen immediately at the point of bet placement. Conversely, if such bet is made in mistake, the actual bet combinations containing two or more associated contingency options can be invalid.</li>
                  <li>â¢ It that provide different markets for similar events from time to time, including within its normal markets (for example, outside of the Exchange Multiple product) such as the market on Chelsea to win the English domestic double (for example, the Premiership and FA Cup.</li>
                  <li>â¢ When making an Exchange Multiple Bet, the prices shown give us an approximate guide as to the price available for each leg and the overall multiple. Rather than Exchange Multiple bets struck at BSP, the price of each leg and the overall multiple price that customers earn will be fixed when the multiple bet is actually placed, and customers will only be able to see these prices. For more information on this customer, please refer to the âhelpâ files.</li>
                  <li>â¢ Horseracing Exchange Multiples are based on the âday of raceâ markets (and not the ante-post markets). Horseracing ante-post rules also do not exist in relation to horseracing Exchange Multiples.</li>
                  <li>10. Rules for Starting Price</li>
                  <li>â¢ The start price (âSPâ) is available on the Exchange. Exchange SP bets (âSP betsâ) are thus a form of Exchange bet. The SP is determined by balancing all SP bets and other Exchange bets while the market is suspended at the âoffâ of the relevant event.</li>
                  <li>â¢ Please notice that the SP bet cannot be revoked for all customers once it has been set.</li>
                  <li>â¢ The SP bet is fixed odd bet, with the odds on each selection being calculated and the bets matched before the event starts. The odds are calculated by matching SP backers and other Exchange backers against SP players and other Exchange layers. The inclusion of other Exchange bets in the SP reconciliation is important to insure that: SP backers benefit from unmatched Exchange offers to lay if those could raise the SP; and SP layers benefit from unmatched Exchange offers to back if those offers could decrease the SP. Including unmatched other Exchange in the SP reconciliation also ensures that the bets of other Exchange backers and layers which may otherwise have lapsed are matched where possible.</li>
                  <li>â¢ The SP is measured at six decimal places for each selection, although it may be seen in the relevant market view (or in any form/result data) at two decimal places, rounded up or down when appropriate. After the reconciliation process, the full SP for each on each selection is accessible by clicking on the respective individual runner graph.</li>
                  <li>â¢ When, for whatever reason, the platform is unavailable when an event happens or the SP cannot be reconciled with the âoffâ otherwise, the SP would be calculated using all available details. For the avoidance of doubt, this information will not be limited to betting activities in the related market(s). Even under such cases, a licensed betting operator within the group can serve as a risk counterparty to SP bets if necessary, to ensure a fair SP bet. Under these cases, the people engaged under assessing the SP should have no unreported personal or other involvement in the SP in question.</li>
                  <li>â¢ If the SP reconciliation process is begun prematurely (for example, if the horserace is switched in-play in error), then it will attempt to undo the reconciliation so that the SP is determined before the event begins. However, there could be situations in which this is not possible, in which case the SP may be based on the original reconciliation.</li>
                  <li>â¢ In these situations where the SP reconciliation is reversed: SP bets (including SP limit bets), âAt In-play: take SPâ bets and âAt In-play: keepâ bets will both revert to their status before the reconciliation; and âAt In-play: Cancelâ bets will either stay cancelled if not matched as part of the reconciliation phase, or if matched as part of the reconciliation process, will revert to their unmatched status until the reconciliation.</li>
                  <li>â¢ When the SP reconciliation procedures is launched rather than scheduled (for example, after the event has started) and determines that a material event has occurred. (this will usually mean that the event is not turned in-play), the SP will be determined purely on the basis of SP bets ( and âAt In-play: Taking SPâ bets that are unmatched when suspends the relevant market), place before the âoffâ. This ensures that âAt In-playâ Take SPâ bets matched after the off are considered invalid and not included in the reconciliation process. In addition, the SP bets made after the âoff will be invalid. However, if the SP reconciliation process is carried out longer than scheduled but concludes that no real event has occurred. All bet will stand.</li>
                  <li>â¢ If a SPâ either wayâ option is presented, it will be treated as two different bets: a win bet on SP and a âto be placedâ bet on SP.</li>
                  <li>â¢ For whatever reason unmatched bets are cancelled prior to the market going in-play, then any unmatched bets that have been picked for âAt In-play: Take SPâ will be transformed to SP bets. After these bets have been converted, they cannot be cancelled.</li>

                <ul class="about_list">
                  <li>â¢ When you put a bet on SP, you are betting against other customers. However, during the reconciliation of SP, it serves as counterparty in order to offset the liabilities between SP bets and other Exchange Bets.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text_14">Placing a SP bet</p>
                <ul class="about_list">
                  <li>â¢ Selecting the âSPâ button in the market view allows customers two separate ways to qualify for an SP bet. They are as follows:</li>
                  <li>â¢ The first option to apply for a bet at SP is by leaving the âSet SP odds limitâ box unticked at the top right of the bet manager. You are expected to enter the stake you want to bet on the option for a back bet. In order to make a lay bet, you are expected to join the liability that you are prepared to gamble against the selection â that is, the amount you are prepared to lose, should the selection win (or is placed as applicable).</li>
                  <li>â¢ The second way to order a bet on SP is to pick the options âPlace SP odds limitâ. Using this, you can order a bet on SP according to a minimum SP odd in the case of a back bet, or a maximum SP odd in the case of a lay bet. If the SP is less than minimum price demanded by the backer or is longer than the maximum price demanded by a layer, the corresponding bet will lapse until the event begins. If the SP is longer than the minimum price demanded by a backer or is shorter than the maximum price required by the layer, the bet will be matched at the SP. Where the SP is equal to the price limit set by customers, such bets should be counted on the basis of the time they have received, on the first come, first served basis, as is this existing convention for other Exchange bets. This ensures that these bets can be either unmatched or partly matched.</li>
                  <li>â¢ Please notice that if a non-runner cannot be withdrawn from the relevant market until after the event has been concluded, the application to all bets matched at or before the âoffâ (including SP bets) of any reduction factor, may mean that the matched price for the SP back bet with the odds limit requested, is changed to a price below the lower limited demanded. This can also mean that the SP lay bet request with the maximum odds requested, cannot be matched even if odds on the selection, after the post-race adjustment for the late non-runner, are below the maximum odds demanded.</li>
                  <li>â¢ If an SP bet with an odds limit is requested, the minimum/maximum odds demanded can be shortened in the case of a back bet or increased in the case of a lay bet at any point before the event begins. However, as mentioned above, an SP bet request cannot necessarily be cancelled by the customer once it has been placed. Details of the effect of non-runners on the SP re are given below.</li>
                  <li>â¢ Exchange bets which are unmatched at the âoffâ</li>
                  <li>â¢ A standard Exchange bet is made by selecting the odds of your selection from the market view (as opposed to clicking on the âSPâ of your selection. When such an Exchange bet is fully or partly unprecedented, it may be changed and cancelled in the usual course. Previously, unparalleled bets were automatically cancelled when the market was suspended at the âoffâ of the event. You can now choose either to have your unmatched Exchange bet converted to an SP bet when the market is suspended at the start of the event, or to have a âpersistâ bet while the event is in-play (see the âkeepâ choice below).</li>
                  <li>â¢ In order to turn your unmatched Exchange bet to an SP bet when the market is suspended, you can pick the âAt In-Play: Take SPâ option from the bet manager. When there is a non-runner on a winning market with a reduction factor of at least 2.5% or a non-runner on market with a reduction factor of at least 4%, it is a strategy to cancel unmatched lay bets on all other runners in the market. In case of any such non-runner, instead of cancelling a lay bet for which the âAt In-Play: Taking SPâ option has been chosen, it will automatically convert to an SP bet. After this conversion, the bet cannot be cancelled. Otherwise, unlike an SP bet, you can opt to cancel an Exchange bet after it has been made, even though you have opted to continue the bet or convert to an SP bet at the outset of the event.</li>
                  <li>â¢ When you want to convert an unprecedented Exchange bet to an SP bet, the Exchange bet liability will be converted into an SP bet liability. Your liability for that SP will never be higher than the liability for the Exchange bet you have mentioned. However, the amount that you will win on the SP lay bet may vary from the amount you have earned if the Exchange bet had been matched based on the final SP.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text_14">Adjustments to SP bet for non-runners</p>
                <ul class="about_list">
                  <li>â¢ In the case of SP back bets, neither the stake nor the odds requested by the customer can be adjusted at any point, given any non-runners or withdrawals. Nevertheless, customers who have chosen the SP limit option may minimize the SP odds that they are prepared to consider on a selection.</li>
                  <li>â¢ For SP lay bets on win markets, the customerâs risk will be reduced on the basis of the reduction factor(s) of the non-runner(s) on which the customerâs bet has been placed. It is to ensure that the balance between the backerâs stakes and the layersâ liability reflects the revised market after the runner has been eliminated.</li>
                  <li>â¢ If the SP bet on the winning market has a maximum odds limit specified, the limit would be diminished by the reduction factor on any non-runner if the non-runner has a reduction factor of at least 2.5%.</li>
                  <li>â¢ In the case of SP lay bets on place markets, the customers liability will also be reduced on the basis of the reduction factor(s) of the non-runner(s) but the calculation will be somewhat different in accordance with the implementation of place market reduction factors. The liability should be decreased by the reduction factor of the eliminated runner. Where the lay bet on the market has a maximum odd limit set, the possible winnings on the bet (for example, odds â 1) will be diminished by the reducing factor of the eliminated runner.</li>
                  <li>â¢ If the SP lay bet in place market has a maximum odds limit set, this limit would be diminished by the reduction factor of any non-runner.</li>
                  <li>â¢ SP lay bets would not be cancelled if there is non-runner.</li>

                <ul class="about_list">
                  <li>â¢ All SP bet will continue so long as your trap selection is not empty or after your bet placement a backup runner is not subsequently entered to run from your trap selection.</li>
                  <li>â¢ All unmatched âConvert to SPâ bets will be cancelled when a reserve is added, or vacant trap is removed.</li>
                  <li>1. âKeepâ bets option</li>
                  <li>â¢ In the case of markets that are scheduled to be turned in-play at the âoffâ, the customer may insist that an unmatched Exchange bet will not be cancelled when the market is turned in-play. It is achieved by choosing the âIn-play: Keepâ option in the bet manager (and checking the request) which ensures that the unmatched bet continues when other unmatched bets are cancelled at the start of the event.</li>
                  <li>â¢ As mentioned above, where a non-runner is withdrawn from the horseracing market(apart from late withdrawals as stated in the next bulled point below), it is protocol to terminate unmatched offers to lay all other horses in the market if the non-runner has a reduction factor of 2.5% or greater for winning markets, or 4% or greater for place markets. In these situations, the opportunity to lay a horse with the âAt In-Play: Keepâ option will not be cancelled. Instead, the lay odds offered in place markets will be lowered in proportion with the reduction factors of any non-runner(s) and the same will apply to win markets provided that the applicable non-runner has a reduction factor of at least 2.5%.</li>
                  <li>â¢ If there is a late withdrawal, may not have time to remove the non-runner from the market before turning it in-play. In such situations, whether it is possible to determined that the late withdrawal is a material runner (for example, a selection with a reduction factor of about 20% or greater on the winning market), it reserves the right to cancel all lay âkeepâ bets (both on the winning and âto be placedâ markets) before turning the market in-play. If there is no cancellation of lay âkeepâ bets in the event of a late withdrawal (for example, it may not be possible to know which horse is withdrawn at the time of the off), any such bets placed before the off and matched in-play will remain at the original chosen price. It ensures that those lay âkeepâ bets will not be subject to any reduction factors arising from the late withdrawal will be applied after the completion of the race to bets matched or before the âoffâ.</li>
                  <li>â¢ Otherwise, in exceptional cases, it reserves the right to cancel âkeepâ bets to protect customers but, unless stipulated in the market rules or market information, the general principle is that a âkeepâ bet will never be cancelled unless it remains unmatched when the market is closed (for the final time) at the end of the event.</li>
                  <li>â¢ To removed ambiguity, this means (for example, where a Material Event takes place in a soccer match and other unmatched bets are cancelled before the market is reopened, a keep bet will not be cancelled.</li>
                  <li>2. Rules of Tote betting</li>
                  <li>â¢ When you place a Tote bet on the platform (for example, a UK or South African Tote bet), you bet against as counterparty to your bet. I will then put the corresponding bet into the appropriate Tote pool as necessary.</li>
                  <li>â¢ A connection to the rules that apply to Tote bets struck as counterparty shall be given within each of the relevant. If there is a discrepancy between those rules either: the similar rules available on the relevant Tote website (for example, on the Tote website for Tote bets); or the similar rules applied by the corresponding host racetrack, the rules on the relevant Tote website or the appropriate horst racetrack must prevail.</li>
                  <li>3. Miscellaneous</li>
                  <li>â¢ All references to time intervals in the Exchange Rules shall apply to the time zone in which the event takes place. For example, a reference to the start time of a football match, relates to the local kick-off time.</li>
                  <li>â¢ All information is done in good faith. Nevertheless, it cannot held responsible for any errors or omissions in relation to any information, such as the posting of prices, runners, hours, ratings, scores, results or general statistics.</li>
                  <li>â¢ It reserves the right to correct any apparent errors and to take all appropriate measures to ensure that markets are administered with integrity and transparency.</li>
                  <li>â¢ If an incorrect team or competitor is shown (excluding minor spelling errors) or an incorrect number of teams, competitors, or results are shown in any complete market or a market is otherwise filled with incorrect details (for example, an incorrect exposure algorithm or a cross matching tool using an incorrect algorithm) or includes apparent mistake, such as the inappropriate implementation of the cross matching tool, then it retains the right to suspend the market and (providing it acts reasonably) to void all bets matched on the market.</li>
                  <li>â¢ Customers are responsible for ensuring that they are pleased that the selection on which they put a bet is their desired selection. Of example, in the case of a competitor with the same name as another person not competing in the relevant market, the onus is on the customer to ensure that they place their bet on their preferred competitor.</li>
                  <li>â¢ It retains the right, at its full and absolute discretion, to suspend the Exchange Market at any moment.</li>
                  <li>â¢ It may, in its full and utter discretion, to suspend betting on the market at any time (even if the suspension is earlier than expected by the Exchange Rules). In order to preserve market credibility and fairness, it may also void certain bets in a market or void a whole market in its entirety.</li>
                  <li>â¢ It reserves the right to amend the Exchange Rules at any given time.</li>
                  <li>â¢ It reserves the rights to cancel unmatched bets in order to protect customers at any given time.</li>

                  <li>â¢ If a match is announced âNo Resultâ, bets will be invalid on all markets for the event, except those markets which will have been unconditionally decided or where the minimum number of overs has been set out in the market specific details.</li>

The market will be turned in-play at the beginning of the Super Over. It is also the duty of all customers to manage their positions because this market will not be actively managed. This market will be settled on the basis of the number of runs scored by each team in the initial Super Over. To prevent uncertainty, if scores are tied at the end of both inning in the Super Over, then the market will be settled as Dead Heat except in situations where more than one Super Over is played, where it will be settled on the winner of the final over. All tie breaker that can be use to decide the winner, including but not limited to a higher number of boundaries, a higher number of sixes, a loss of fewer wickets, coin toss, etc. do not count for the purpose of this market.</li>

                  <li>â¢ If it does not postpone the market in time for the occurrence of a Material Event, it reserves the right to void bets unfairly matched after the Material Event has happened. The voiding of such bets can take place during the event or retrospectively after the game is over.</li>

If it does have knowledge that the game will played within three days and that the game is played within three days, then all bets will stand except if the match is restarted from the beginning. If the match is restarted from the start, then all bets played matched before the market went in-play will stand, but any bets placed in-play will be invalid, except for any bets placed in-play on markets that have been unconditionally decided will stand.</li>
                  <li>â¢ For friendly matches, all bets refer to the maximum duration of play according on the match officials, plays any stoppage time. If the friendly match beings but is then abandoned or postponed and is not finished ( for example, the entire length of the play according to match officials, plus any stoppage time) within three days of the scheduled start date, all bets will be invalid, except those on markets that have been unconditionally determined. In the case of confusion as to the final result from match officials, the results will be decided (acting reasonably) using information from unbiased sources.</li>
                  <li>â¢ If the official fixture contains different team details to those listed (for example, team name, substitutes, age group, gender, etc.) then all bets matched on the affected markets will be invalid. In all other cases, bets will stand (including where a name of the team is indicated without specifying the term âXIâ in the name). When an official fixture is shown on the website under an inaccurate competition name, it reserves the right to void all bets matched on the affected markets.</li>
                  <li>â¢ If the team is relegated to the league because, by the end of the season, it has finished the relegation positions that are applicable to the league (for example, typically any of the bottom three league positions), bets on the team to be regulated will be decided as winning bets. If a team is otherwise disqualified, kicked out or excluded from the league (for example, in circumstances other than those where it has finished the season with the relevant relegation positions): (i) if such team is disqualified, kicked out or excluded from the league prior to the start of the relevant season, all betting on the affected market will be invalid (and a new market will subsequently be loaded) and (ii) if such team is disqualified, kicked out or removed from the league after the relevant reason has started (or a determination is made by the applicable governing body, during the season, that the team will be kicked out or excluded from the league following the seasonâs conclusion), all bets on the team involved will be invalid. For further prevent uncertainty, if a point deduction is imposed on a team such that if finishes the season in relegation places which are relevant to the applicable league, bets on the team to be relegated will be settled as winning bets.</li>
                  <li>â¢ The relevant season will deemed to have begun after the first league game has been played. For the purposes of this rule, markets relating to individual matches would be not considered to be âaffected marketsâ,</li>
                  <li>â¢ âShirt numbersâ bets apply to the number of shirts assigned at the start of the match. âShirt numbersâ bets will include own-goal scorers. Any player whose shirts donât have number will be allocated the number 12.</li>
                  <li>â¢ In âtime of first goalâ bets (for example, âFirst Goal Oddsâ markets), the first half is deemed to last 45 minutes, regardless of the time of stoppage. Also, for these markets, please note that the â0-10 Minutesâ range must cover the first 10 minutes of the match. In other words, itâs going from 0:00 until -before the clock hits 10:00. The â11-20 minutesâ selection runs from 10:00 until before the clock hits 20:00. The same principles applied to each of the other offerings in the market.</li>
                  <li>â¢ For âtop goal scorerâ markets, only the goals scored in the league or competition set out in the Market Information count.

Your own goals will not count.</li>
                  <li>â¢ For markets that refer to the number of events to arise, such as the ânumber of cornersâ, these may be measured on the basis of the number taken, rather than awarded.</li>
                  <li>â¢ For the case of markets that refer to the number of bookings, the number of corners taken, any goal scorer or the time of a given goal, the outcome should be determined (acting reasonably) using information from independent sources. In such cases, if any new information comes into the public domain within 48 hours of the date of settlement, it shall (in a fair manner) decide either: (i) whether the market will be reinstated or resettled in the light of this new information; or (ii) wait for more information before determining whether to reinstate or resettled the market. Unless it has declared that is waiting for more information, any information that entered into the public domain more than 48 hours after a market has been settled shall not be considered (irrespective of whether or not such information could have led to a different outcome).</li>
                  <li>3. Tennis</li>
                  <li>â¢ If the player or pairing retires or is disqualified in any match, the player or pairing progressing to the next round (or wins the tournament in the case of the final) will be declared the winner. Nevertheless, if less than one set has been completed at the time of retirement or disqualification, all bets relating to that individual match will be invalid.</li>
                  <li>â¢ All bets relating to the number of occurrences of such events during the tournament would be invalid if the length of the tournament is shortened, postponed or cancelled, except for those on markets that have been unconditionally determined.</li>
                  <li>â¢ All bets will stand irrespective of modification to the scheduled venues, including any modifications to a different type of surface.</li>
                  <li>â¢ If the scheduled duration of a match is shortened or increase in the number of games, sets required to win, all bets will be invalid, except for hose on markets that have been unconditionally determined. Please note that this does not apply to âMatch Oddsâ or âSet Winerâ markets for Davis Cup matches or âdead rubberâ matches that have been shortened from five to three sets after the market has been loaded, provided that the match has been shortened in compliance with the competition rules.</li>
                  <li>â¢ Where markets are offered on individual games or sets within a match, retirement or disqualification during a game or set will render bets on the game or set market and all individual game or set markets void except those on markets which have been unconditionally determined.</li>
